====== Decision Matrix ======

The full functionality of the decision matrix is explained [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=decision_matrix|in the specification]]. 

Paris have a decision matrix consisting of eight entries. This matrix can be used to control the relays. Possible actions are listed in the table below.

^ Action ^ Action code ^ Parameter ^Description ^
|  **NOOP**  |  0 (0x00)  |  Not used  | No operation. Will do absolutely nothing. |
|  **ACTIVATE**  |  1 (0x01)  |  Relays to activate (bit array)  | Activate relay(s) given by argument. The argument is a bit array where bit 0 is relay 1 and so on. That is a position with a set bit will activate the corresponding relay. Byte 1 is Zone and byte 2 is sub-zone and must be equal to register content to trigger action. |
|  **DEACTICATE**  |  2 (0x02)  | Relays to deactivate (bit array) | Deactivate relay(s) given by argument. The argument is a bit array where bit 0 is relay 1 and so on. That is a position with a set bit will inactivate the corresponding relay. Byte 1 is Zone and byte 2 is sub-zone and must be equal to register content to trigger action. |
|  **PULSEON**  |  3 (0x03)  |  Relays to pulse (bit array) | Pulse relay(s) given by argument. The argument is a bit array where bit 0 is relay 1 and so on. That is a position with a set bit will toggle the corresponding relay. Byte 1 is Zone and byte 2 is sub-zone and must be equal to register content to trigger action. |
|  -  |  4 (0x04)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  5 (0x05)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  6 (0x06)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  7 (0x07)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  8 (0x08)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  9 (0x09)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  **STATUS**  |  10 (0x0a)  |  Relays to send status for (bit array)  | Send relay status. The argument is a bit array where bit 0 is relay 1 and so on. That is a position with a set bit will have a status event sent for the corresponding relay.|
|  -  |  11 (0x0b)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  12 (0x0c)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  13 (0x0d)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  14 (0x0e)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  -  |  15 (0x0f)  |  -  | Reserved. |
|  **DISABLE**  |  16 (0x10)  |  Relays to disable (bit array)  | Disable relay(s) given by argument. The argument is a bit array where bit 0 is relay 1 and so on. That is a position with a set bit will disable the corresponding relay. Byte 1 is Zone and byte 2 is zone page and must be equal to register content to trigger action. |
