Accra is a module that have four counter channels that each can count
pulses and measure frequency. Each channel can have alarms set for going
over a counter level or when counting down to zero and for a frequency
that goes outside of a specified frequency window.

It has a built-in linear calculation algorithm that can translate pulse
to real world measurement units. This can for example be used for
utility meter measurements and gives the correct measurement value sent
out on the VSCP bus.

The module comes with a GUID and is programmed with a bootloader and
VSCP module functionality that works right out of the box.
