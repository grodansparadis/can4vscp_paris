			This is the pulse time for the each relay expressed in seconds. This can be used to have a relay turn on and off with a certain preset interval. The min pulse time is 1 second and the max time is 65535 seconds which is about 18 hours. Set to zero (default) for no pulse time i.e. the relay will be steady on/off.\n
			To start a pulse sequence first write the pulse time to this register and then write 2 to the relay status register to start the output. The pulse train is terminated by writing on or off (1 or 0) to the relay status register.\n
