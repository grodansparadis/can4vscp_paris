**An error has occurred, and the archive could not be created.**

Most likely it's one of the following situations:
  * Plugin can't write to the media directory...
  * The program ran out of usable memory (RAM)...
  * You ran out of usable disk space...
  * You're experiencing an actual hardware failure (for instance, disk failure.)

Other possibilities exist-- execution time constraints, non-standard tar, gzip, bzip2, or something else completely different, but these aren't really as likely to occur.

Your best course of action is to check each item above, resolve it, and try again.

Don't forget to check your disk and RAM quotas for your host if you have them, and look for possible problems in your file system (very large files, for instance.)
