====== Getting started ======
 
You need

  * RJ-45 patch cables or similar.
  * A stable +9V - +28V DC power source.
  * A host computer with a serial or USB interface.

The Paris module is powered from the CAN4VSCP bus. [[http://www.grodansparadis.com/wiki/doku.php?id=connecting_can4vscp_devices_together|This article]] have information on how the bus is powered and set up. Follow it for a reliable setup. Don't forget the 120 ohm terminators at each end of the bus. __They are important!__  You can activate the on board terminator on the Paris module if it is located at one end of your bus.

When you power the module by inserting the RJ-45 cable the red LED on the board should light up to indicate it is powered. This is just a power indicator LED. When you power the board for the first time the green led starts to blink to indicate that the module search for a nickname. During normal operation this LED should light steady. 

Remember that there need to be __at least two__ CAN4VSCP (or other CAN device set to 125kbps) devices (one additional if you have the [[http://www.grodansparadis.com/frankfurt/rs232/frankfurt-rs232.html|Frankfurt RS-232]]) on the bus to be able to communicate. A single device can't talk by itself on a bus. It's an error.
