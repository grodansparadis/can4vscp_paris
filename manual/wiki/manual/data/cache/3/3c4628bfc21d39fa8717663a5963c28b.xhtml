<p>
A relay can be active (on) or inactive(off). In registers 2-8 you can read or write
the status for an individual relay. A zero mean the relay is off, and a one that
it is on. So writing a one to register 2 of a Paris relay module will turn relay
1 on. A better way however is to use the <a href="http://www.grodansparadis.com/paris/manual/doku.php?id=decisionmatrix" class="urlextern" title="http://www.grodansparadis.com/paris/manual/doku.php?id=decisionmatrix" rel="nofollow">decision matrix</a> of the module to accomplish this.

<p>
Normally the <a href="http://www.grodansparadis.com/paris/manual/doku.php?id=decisionmatrix" class="urlextern" title="http://www.grodansparadis.com/paris/manual/doku.php?id=decisionmatrix" rel="nofollow">decision matrix</a> of the module is the best way to to handle relay state changes. This much more flexible then to use the register writes directly. This is also why the zone/sub-zone registers should be initialized with meaningful values. The decision matrix of this module can have eight entries. Each entry is a line that look for a specified event on the bus and perform a specific action if this event is found. Typically this can be a ON-event sent to a specific zone/sub-zone. 
</p>

<p>
A row in the decision matrix can be setup to turn on/off one or more relays if this event is detected and if the zone/sub-zone is the one expected. At first the setup of the decision matrix can be hard to grasp. You can read all about it in the <a href="http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=decision_matrix" class="urlextern" title="http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=decision_matrix" rel="nofollow">VSCP specification</a>. Here we will just at a simple example.
</p>

<p>
The decision matrix consist of eight bytes. The first byte is the originating
address. You can set a nickname here for the node that is allowed to trigger
(perform) a selected action. The control byte have configuration bits(flags) for
how the information should be interpreted. One bit (bit 6) tells if the originating
address should be checked or not. That is if bit 6 is set then the originating
address must be the same as the byte stored in the first byte of the decision
matrix to trigger the action. Bit 7 must always be set for the row to be compared
ton an incoming event. Bit four and five, if set, check if byte 1 and 2 of the
incoming event is the same as the zone/sub-zone stored in register3 0/1 of the
module. 
</p>

<p>
Byte 2/3 together with bits 0/1 of the control register is the class mask and filter. A ninth bit is needed as a VSCP class consist of nine bits. 
</p>

<p>
Byte 4/5 is the type mask and filter. This is something most newcomers to VSCP have problems with. But is is actually really simple. The following table illustrates how this works
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit7"><table class="inline">
	<thead>
	<tr class="row0">

The decision matrix makes it very easy to set up systems where one event triggers actions on several modules. It is also easy to adopt your system to new demands. You can add and replace modules without affecting the system functionality.

<h3 class="sectionedit10" id="pulsing_outputs">Pulsing outputs</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
If you want your relay output to be turned on/off with a certain interval the Paris relay module automatically can handle this for you. First set the time the relay should be on/off in register 18-33. There are two registers for each relay and the time is given in seconds. The lower byte holds the most significant byte and the higher byte holds the least significant byte. 
</p>

<p>
As and example: If you want relay 0 to have an output that is on for five minutes and then off for five minutes and so on you first calculate how many seconds the pulse time is. In this case 5 * 60 = 300 seconds. This is what should go into register 18 and 19. 300/256 = 1 which is what should go into register 18 and the rest (300 - 1*256 = 44 ) 44 forms the least signicant byte and should go to register 19. To start the pulse output you also have to set bit 0 in the corresponding relay control register to one.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Pulsing outputs&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;pulsing_outputs&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:0,&quot;secid&quot;:10,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;7048-7969&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit11" id="protection_timer">Protection timer</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A protection timer can be convenient to use to protect a system form malfunctions in some of it&#039;s components. Suppose you have a relay that controls a pump that fills a tank with some liquid. The pump should then be turned off when a the tanks is full which is indicated by an event from a sensor on the tank. If this sensor is broken or the cable to the module is broken this event will never be received. With the protection timer activated the pump will be turned of anyway before things get to bad. It is also possible to send an alarm when this happens to inform the rest of the system. 
</p>

<p>
The protection timers are in registers 34-47 and comes, like the pulse registers, in pairs. The first byte in a pair holds the most significant byte of the timer and the second the least significant byte. Also as for the pulse time the time set is given in seconds. A maximum of 65535 seconds can thus be stored. So the range is one seconds up to around eighteen hours.
</p>

<p>
The protection timer, if activated, is started when you activate the protected relay. If the relay is active when the timer elapse it will be turned off. If you activate the relay again before the timer has elapsed the protection timer will be resettled and start to count down from the preset value again. If you turn of the relay the timer will be inactivated until the relay is activated again. Both relay control through actions and register writes affects the timer.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Protection timer&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;protection_timer&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:0,&quot;secid&quot;:11,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;7970-9435&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit12" id="alarm">Alarm</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The module can send alarm events if the protection timer elapses. When an alarm occurs a bit is set in the alarm register which is located in register position 128. You can always read this register to see if the module have sent out and alarm events. When you read the register the alarm bits will be cleared.
